    "### Spectra and Spectroscopy\n",
    "1. [Doppler Shift Interactives](Interactives/DopplerShift.ipynb) - These Doppler Shift interactives are designed to allow students to first model simple Doppler Shift and then to model the more complicated time-varying Doppler Shift seen in binary star and exoplanetary systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eclipsing Binaries\n",
    "1. [Binary Star Simulation Interactive](Interactives/Binary_Star_Sim.ipynb) -  This interactive contains a full 3D simulation of a binary star system, including a radial velocity or light curve for that system.  The user can control most physical parameters of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Stars and Keplerâ€™s Laws\n",
    "1. [Center of Mass Interactive](Interactives/Center_of_Mass.ipynb) - This interactive model simply allows a student to adjust the mass and separation of two stars and see the shifts of their orbits, illustrating the center of mass position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building an HR diagram\n",
    "1. [Blackbody Spectra Interactives](Interactives/Blackbody_Simulation.ipynb) - This set of interactive figures can be used to explore the properties of the Blackbody spectrum as applied to stars.  \n",
    "2. [Building an HR Diagram](Interactives/Plotting_HR_Diagram.ipynb) - This interactive just allows you to make an HR diagram by entering the numbers into a spreadsheet without having to know how to make a logarithmic plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HR Diagrams of Star Clusters\n",
    "1. [HR Diagram Interactives](Interactives/HR_Diagram.ipynb) - This set of interactive plots allows a student to explore the data that goes into the HR diagram, then how main sequence fitting can be used to determine the distance to a star cluster, and finally, how detailed stellar evolution models can be used to also determine the age of a star cluster.\n"
