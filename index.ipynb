    "[*Astro Interactives*](https://juancab.github.io/AstroInteractives/) is a series of Jupyter Notebooks meant to provide interactive demos and simulations for introductory astronomy courses (and in a few cases, upper-division astrophysics courses). These notebooks were initially developed by Professor Juan Cabanela, Andrew Louwagie Gordon (MSUM class of 2019), and Sam Holen (MSUM Class of 2019)."
