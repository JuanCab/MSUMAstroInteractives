    "1. [Binary Star Simulation Interactive](Interactives/Binary_Star_Sim.ipynb) -  This interactive contains a full 3D simulation of a binary star system, including a radial velocity or light curve for that system.  The user can control most physical parameters of the system.\n",
    "1. [Blackbody Spectra Interactives](Interactives/Blackbody_Simulation.ipynb) - This set of interactive figures can be used to explore the properties of the Blackbody spectrum as applied to stars.  \n",
    "1. [HR Diagram Interactives](Interactives/HR_Diagram.ipynb) - This set of interactive plots allows a student to explore the data that goes into the HR diagram, then how main sequence fitting can be used to determine the distance to a star cluster, and finally, how detailed stellar evolution models can be used to also determine the age of a star cluster.\n",
    "1. [Synthetic $\\ell$-v Diagram](Interactives/Synthetic_LV_Diagram.ipynb) -  This interactive takes a Milky Way-like rotation curve and neutral gas profile and generates a synthetic $\\ell$-v diagram.  Users can then simply trace out a new rotation curve or neutral gas profile and see the corresponding $\\ell$-v diagram.\n",
    "2. [Synthetic HI Spectra](Interactives/Synthetic_Galaxy_HI_Spectra.ipynb) - This interactive model allows a student to see the single-dish (unresolve) HI spectra or the resolved HI spectra (aka velocity map) corresponding to a given model galaxy.  As with the $\\ell$-v diagram interactive, users can  trace out a new rotation curve or neutral gas profile and see the corresponding spectra."
